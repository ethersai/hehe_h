Core operations:

    init - Initialize a new dynamic array
    free - Deallocate the array and reset fields

    clear - Remove all elements but keep capacity
    reserve - Pre-allocate capacity to avoid multiple reallocations

Access:

    get - Get element at index (with bounds checking)
    set - Set element at index (with bounds checking)
    pop - Remove and return last element
    remove_at - Remove element at specific index (shifts elements)

Insertion:

    insert_at - Insert element at specific index (shifts elements)
    prepend - Add element to the beginning

Bulk operations:

    append_many - Add multiple elements at once
    extend - Append another dynamic array to this one
    copy - Create a deep copy of the array

Search & manipulation:

    find - Search for element (returns index or -1)
    contains - Check if element exists
    reverse - Reverse the order of elements
    swap - Swap two elements by index

Memory optimization:

    shrink_to_fit - Reduce capacity to match count
    resize - Change count and adjust capacity if needed

Iteration helpers:

    for_each - Apply function to each element
    map - Transform elements using a function
    filter - Create new array with elements matching predicate
